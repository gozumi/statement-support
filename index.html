            <p>The brief for <b>We Will Be Martians</b> was to create an original soundtrack for the provided film ‘We
                Will
                be Martians’, which is part of the Music Tech A Level exam. This was my first time attempting to create
                a 3 minute soundtrack for a space-related film.
            </p>
            <p>Upon initially watching the film, my first thoughts were that I wanted to create a story through my
                sound. As the film could be interpreted as a series of ‘outer space’ scenes with no correlation, my aim
                was to link the images with music and create a narrative. Furthermore, I set out to match most of the
                moving images with sounds that would be associated with the image e.g. the loud rumbling of a rocket
                ship. However, I didn’t want to give sound to each and every movement in the film, as that would make
                the piece become predictable. This decision was also made so as to leave the viewer with the freedom to
                imagine what sounds could have been used in the ‘empty moments’, giving the piece more interest and room
                for thought and discussion by the audience.</p>
            <p>
                I put together my story through my sound by creating motifs for specific scenes and images that reoccur
                in the film, for example, the use of the triangle when the flower seeds enter the frame. The use of the
                4 note pattern was a strong highlight of this, as it reappears towards the end of the extract but is
                played through the strings instead of the synths heard at the start.
            <p>As this piece is still a work in progress, I would like to adjust the levels of all the tracks further
                to reduce the distortion of the sound. Additionally, to fit the A Level brief, I will adjust some of the
                Logic stock synths and change the tracks to original synths I have created, and use some samples in the
                piece too - both original and others already created.</p>

            <p><b>Rain Sinattra</b> is a jazz extract that I was asked to produce for a scene within a short film. The
                brief was to create an up-tempo jazz track matching 140 bpm.</p>

            <p><b>Jungle Space</b> was an early house piece I created using Logic stock loops. This was a piece I made
                to challenge myself in terms of constructing an afro-house styled track that continuously engaged the
                listener, whilst using your traditional repeated house music format.</p>

            <p><b>D Minor Concerto</b>: This is an unfinished Baroque Concerto in D minor that I created as a music A
                Level composition. I used the Logic stocks instruments however, to approve the work my intention is to
                use the plug-in ‘Omnisphere’ as VST’s The aim to complete this piece of music is to add a final episode
                towards the end of the extract and then conclude the piece with the last ritornello in the Tonic Key.

            <p><b>Matrix</b> is an experimental fusion excerpt I constructed to match the scene of an character walking
                through tough terrain for countless years - this led me to call it matrix as a metaphor to resemble this
                character's journey. My inspiration was taken from an artistic short film I experienced by Kehinde Wiley
                called ‘in search of the miraculous’.</p>
