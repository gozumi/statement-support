      <p>The brief for <b>We Will Be Martians</b> was to create an original soundtrack for the
        provided film ‘We
        Will
        be Martians’, which is part of the Music Tech A Level exam. This was my first time
        attempting to create
        a 3 minute soundtrack for a space-related film.
      </p>
      <p>Upon initially watching the film, my first thoughts were that I wanted to create a story
        through my
        sound. As the film could be interpreted as a series of ‘outer space’ scenes with no
        correlation, my aim
        was to link the images with music and create a narrative. Furthermore, I set out to
        match most of the
        moving images with sounds that would be associated with the image e.g. the loud rumbling
        of a rocket
        ship. However, I didn’t want to give sound to each and every movement in the film, as
        that would make
        the piece become predictable. This decision was also made so as to leave the viewer with
        the freedom to
        imagine what sounds could have been used in the ‘empty moments’, giving the piece more
        interest and room
        for thought and discussion by the audience.</p>
      <p>
        I put together my story through my sound by creating motifs for specific scenes and
        images that reoccur
        in the film, for example, the use of the triangle when the flower seeds enter the frame.
        The use of the
        4 note pattern was a strong highlight of this, as it reappears towards the end of the
        extract but is
        played through the strings instead of the synths heard at the start.
      <p>As this piece is still a work in progress, I would like to adjust the levels of all the
        tracks further
        to reduce the distortion of the sound. Additionally, to fit the A Level brief, I will
        adjust some of the
        Logic stock synths and change the tracks to original synths I have created, and use some
        samples in the
        piece too - both original and others already created.</p>

      <p><b>Rain Sinattra</b> is a jazz extract that I was asked to produce for a scene within a short
        film. The
        brief was to create an up-tempo jazz track matching 140 bpm.</p>

      <p><b>Jungle Space</b> was an early house piece I created using Logic stock loops. This was a
        piece I made
        to challenge myself in terms of constructing an afro-house styled track that
        continuously engaged the
        listener, whilst using your traditional repeated house music format.</p>

      <p><b>D Minor Concerto</b>: This is an unfinished Baroque Concerto in D minor that I created as
        a music A
        Level composition. I used the Logic stocks instruments however, to approve the work my
        intention is to
        use the plug-in ‘Omnisphere’ as VST’s The aim to complete this piece of music is to add
        a final episode
        towards the end of the extract and then conclude the piece with the last ritornello in
        the Tonic Key.

      <p><b>VVS neck</b> is a melodic drill track made for an artist to rap (freestyle) over. It uses
        the
        conventional drill 808 glides as well as the fast bpm to match the urban sounding genre.

      <p><b>Matrix</b> is an experimental fusion excerpt I constructed to match the scene of an
        character walking
        through tough terrain for countless years - this led me to call it matrix as a metaphor
        to resemble this
        character's journey. My inspiration was taken from an artistic short film I experienced
        by Kehinde Wiley
        called ‘in search of the miraculous’.</p>
